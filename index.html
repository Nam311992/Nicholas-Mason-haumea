       <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Im still very new to coding but Im really optimistic about learning and understand how to do it. I mostly struggle with how to communicate with people that I could be working with using github and the terminal for some reason that is kind of a struggle. Besides that I am currently a truck Driver for a company called Riley Brothers and Im doing what I can to find a way to either get more money from them or add some more credintials to my license. Im also in a committed relationship.
